# hello-world
This is my first time using Github, heard a lot about it but not "exactly" sure what it is.


this is a new branch of of the helloworld repository.
basically a branch is a copy of the master repsitory code,  one can edit and make changes to the branch and leave them for riewing for it to be found suitable for the master code or not.
